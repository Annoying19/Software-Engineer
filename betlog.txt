betlog notes:

doon sa scheduling system, ganto magiging update:

in the calendar GUI, display Member Name and beside it Employee Name, but store in the schedule table the Member ID and Employee ID
Use search name that includes a list widget for both the assignation of member and employee in the appointment, 


in the database, once the schedule was add, the status will be ongoing, and it will be shown at the table, place it last

and in the table, once the row is selected, you can cancel the schedule, with the cancel schedule button
is beside the "add appointment" button, there's a "Cancel Appointment" button, but the 
button will be enabled if they click a certain row, once the row is clicked and the "cancel appointment" button is clicked,
it will open a new window that will ask "are you sure?", once the confirm button is clicked, the status of that certain appointment is cancelled, 
if cancelled, the schedule that we will set in that date and time, if they want to set a new appointment in that certain date,
will not have a conflict schedule
