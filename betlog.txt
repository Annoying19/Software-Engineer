betlog notes:

doon sa scheduling system, ganto magiging update:

in the calendar GUI, Member ID must be Member Name, and beside Member Name is Employee Name,
in the "add employee", replace the Member ID as Member Name, instead of dropdown, use search name,
below that, there's a table that will show the names of the Member including the member_id, 
add Employee Name, same functionality as Member Name, but place it below the Member Table,

in the database, once the schedule was add, the status will be active, and it will be shown at the table, right beside the Name in table

and in the table, once the row is selected, you can cancel the schedule, the cancel schedule button
is beside the "add appointment" button, there's a "Cancel Appointment" button, but the 
button will be able if they click a certain row, once the row is clicked and the "cancel appointment" button is clicked,
it will open a new window app that will ask "are you sure?", once the yes button is clicked, the status of that certain appointment is inactive,
and the schedule that we will set in that date and time, if they want to set a new appointment in that certain date,
will not have a conflict schedule
